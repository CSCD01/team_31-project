Comments:

I was very happy to see that the team came fully prepared to deliver a
professional presentation. Every team member seemed to be well
informed and actively participated in the interview.


The team introduction was done well, in a professional manner. 

The project was introduced well, including a good demonstration.

The requirement to present reasons for selecting the project are, of
course, waived.

You presented convincing arguments for choosing the software process.

As we have discussed, there are details missing in the software
process. I would be happy to replace this part of the interview grade
with what you achieve in the second interview.
